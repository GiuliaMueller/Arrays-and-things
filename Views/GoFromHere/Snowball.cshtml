<h1> Snowball Method</h1>

<h3>
    In the Snowball method, the strategy is to organize all debts from least amount due to greatest.  First attack the debt with the least amount until it is gone, and then
    roll that payment amount into attacking the next smallest debt.  Remember you are still responsible to make the minimum payments on each of the other debts along the way.
</h3>


<h3>
    Let's say for example you have three debts to pay, Student Loan at $23,674 with an interest rate of 4.27%, Medical Bill at $12,813 with an interest rate of 4.9%, and
    Car Loan at $19,985 with an interest rate of 5%.  Using the Hybrid method the first thing you would do is to organize the debt interest rate amounts from greatest to least.

<h3>
    The Medical Bill has the least overall debt balance.  Your goal is to get rid of that debt as soon as possible.  While making the minimum payments on the Car Loan and the Student Loan,
    you will also make EXTRA payments on the Medical Bill.  Your extra payment may only be $5 over the minimum amount, that's ok.  Pay as much as you can in extra based on your income.
    Once the Medical Bill is paid off, roll the $294.49 (plus your extra payment) into a new extra payment on the Car Loan!

<h3>The Snowball methood seems slow to start.  Once the first account has been paid down, watch how quickly the next, and the next will be paid off!  </h3>
