<h1> Avalanche Method</h1>

<h3>
    In the Avalanche method, the strategy is to organize all debts from highest interest rate amount due to lowest.  First attack the debt with the highest interest rate amount until it is gone, 
    and then focus on the next largest interest rate debt.  Remember you are still responsible to make the minimum payments on each of the other debts along the way.
</h3>


<h3>
    Let's say for example you have three debts to pay, Student Loan at $23,674 with an interest rate of 4.27%, Medical Bill at $12,813 with an interest rate of 4.9%, and 
    Car Loan at $19,985 with an interest rate of 5%.  Using the Avalanche method the first thing you would do is to organize the debt interest rate amounts from greatest to least.

<h3>
    The Car Loan has the greatest overall interest rate.  Your goal is to get rid of that debt as soon as possible, because the higher interst rate is costing you more money.  
    While making the minimum payments on the Medical Bill and the Student Loan, you will also make EXTRA payments on the Car Loan.  Your extra payment may only be $5 over the 
    minimum amount, that's ok.  Pay as much as you can in extra based on your income.  Once the Car Loan is paid off, move on to attacking the Medical Bill with extra payments.
</h3>

<h3>The Avalanche methood focuses on saving you money in interest payments.  Paying off the highest interest rate first will save more money than paying the lower interest rates off first.  </h3>
